MAGIHome

A launcher decompile from SHARP SH-06D NERV base on adw launcher

Most source from [adw launcher standalone branch](https://github.com/AnderWeb/android_packages_apps_Launcher/tree/standalone), other code is decompile form SH-06D MAGIHome.

but now the code has a lot of problems, sach as screen switching does not work, long touch not work so main screen con't do any thing, but polytope is working.

I'm not a real Android/Java developer and understand OpenGL, so can't get the right name in gl part, just only let it work.

Welcome to the perfect code
